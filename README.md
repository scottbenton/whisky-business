Recipe Storage System

Written in React using Typescript

## Setup

In order to authenticate against AWS cognito you need to setup a new cognito instance, and then take the poolId and clientId and pass those into the application via environment variables.

Since this is bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, you will need to pass those in as `REACT_APP_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_COGNITO_POOL_ID`

## Test
